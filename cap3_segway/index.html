         I saw some Burma Shave style sings on the side of the road today:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
                 Passing cars,<br> When you can't see,<br> may get you,<br> A glimpse,<br> of eternity.
      </blockquote>

      <p> 
         I definitely won't be passing any cars

         My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: cell phone, ipod, digital camera, and a protein bar. Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said , <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with on segway.</q>
